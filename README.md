The "Talkbot" project is an innovative chatbot system designed to provide multiple functionalities through a web-based interface. This system incorporates three distinct chatbot types to cater to various user needs. 
The first chatbot is an adaptive learning chatbot that evolves by learning from user inputs and updating its memory. 
The second chatbot functions as a translator, enabling users to translate text between different languages.
The third chatbot is a general-purpose conversational bot that interacts with users in a natural language format. 
 
The backend of the chatbots is developed using Python and the Flask framework, providing a lightweight and efficient structure for handling communication and data processing. The web interface is created using HTML and CSS for the frontend design, while Express JS is employed for the server-side logic, ensuring smooth interaction between the client and server. This combination of technologies results in a versatile and responsive system that can be further expanded to incorporate additional chatbot features.
